## Suggestions & Improvements

1. **Indemnification Clause**: This clause is crucial as it protects both parties from potential legal claims arising from the consultant's work. It ensures that each party is responsible for their own actions and any resulting legal issues.

2. **Non-Solicitation Clause**: This clause prevents the consultant from poaching the client's employees or clients, which is important for maintaining the client's business stability and relationships.

3. **Force Majeure Clause**: Including this clause protects both parties from liabilities due to unforeseen events beyond their control, such as natural disasters or other emergencies, ensuring that neither party is unfairly penalized for circumstances they cannot control.
