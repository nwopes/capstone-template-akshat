    "ip_details": "To determine whether a contract clearly defines Intellectual Property (IP) ownership, you would need to review the specific language and clauses related to IP within the contract. Here are some key elements to look for:\n\n1. **Definition of Intellectual Property**: The contract should clearly define what constitutes IP within the context of the agreement. This might include patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, and any other relevant forms of IP.\n\n2. **Ownership Clause**: The contract should explicitly state who owns the IP. This could be the creator, the employer, or another party, depending on the nature of the agreement.\n\n3. **Assignment of Rights**: If the IP is being transferred from one party to another, the contract should include an assignment clause that details this transfer.\n\n4. **Licensing Terms**: If the IP is being licensed rather than transferred, the contract should specify the terms of the license, including scope, duration, and any limitations.\n\n5. **Work for Hire**: If applicable, the contract should include a \"work for hire\" clause, which typically means that the employer or commissioning party owns the IP created by an employee or contractor.\n\n6. **Dispute Resolution**: The contract should outline how disputes regarding IP ownership will be resolved.\n\n7. **Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure**: There should be clauses that protect the confidentiality of the IP and any related information.\n\n8. **Termination and Consequences**: The contract should specify what happens to the IP upon termination of the agreement.\n\nTo provide a 'Pass' or 'Fail' judgment, you would need to evaluate whether these elements are present and clearly articulated in the contract. If the contract includes these elements and they are clearly defined, it would likely 'Pass'. If any of these elements are missing or unclear, it would likely 'Fail', and you should specify which elements are lacking or ambiguous.",
