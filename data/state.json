Who will own the intellectual property rights upon completion?\n\n- **Confidentiality:**\n  - Include a confidentiality clause to protect any sensitive information shared during the project.\n\n- **Termination Clause:**\n  - Define the conditions under which either party can terminate the agreement. What are the consequences of termination?\n\n- **Dispute Resolution:**\n  - Specify how disputes will be resolved. Will there be mediation, arbitration, or litigation?\n\n- **Governing Law:**\n  - Identify the jurisdiction whose laws will govern the contract.\n\n#### 2. **Identify Potential Risks**\n\n- **Ambiguity:**\n  - Look for vague terms or language that could lead to misunderstandings or disputes.\n\n- **Scope Creep:**\n  - Ensure that the scope of work is clearly defined to prevent additional work without compensation.\n\n- **Non-Payment:**\n  - Consider the risk of non-payment and whether a deposit or payment schedule could mitigate this risk.\n\n- **Quality and Performance:**\n  - Assess the risk of the website not meeting Jane Smith's expectations. Are there quality standards or acceptance criteria?\n\n- **Legal Compliance:**\n  - Ensure that the contract complies with relevant laws and regulations, such as consumer protection laws.\n\n#### 3. **Recommendations for Improvement**\n\n- Based on the identified necessary clauses and potential risks, provide recommendations for improving the contract. This may include adding missing clauses, clarifying ambiguous terms, or suggesting additional protections for both parties.\n\n#### 4. **Consultation with Legal Professionals**\n\n- If necessary, recommend consulting with a legal professional to ensure that the contract is legally sound and enforceable.\n\nBy following this research plan, you can ensure that the contract between John Doe and Jane Smith is comprehensive, clear, and minimizes potential risks for both parties."

      "report": "The contract appears to be well-structured and covers many essential elements. However, there are a few areas that could be improved or clarified:\n\n1. **Placeholder Usage**: \n   - Ensure that all placeholders such as [DATE], [CLIENT_ADDRESS], [CLIENT_CONTACT_INFORMATION], [CONTRACTOR_ADDRESS], [CONTRACTOR_CONTACT_INFORMATION], [COMPLETION_DATE], and [HOURLY_RATE] are filled in with the appropriate information before the contract is finalized.\n\n2. **Indemnification Clause**: \n   - As suggested, adding an indemnification clause would be beneficial to protect both parties from any claims or liabilities arising from the project.\n\n3. **Non-Solicitation Clause**: \n   - Including a non-solicitation clause could help protect both parties' business interests by preventing the poaching of employees or contractors.\n\n4. **Force Majeure Clause**: \n   - Adding a force majeure clause would provide protection against unforeseen events that could prevent either party from fulfilling their contractual obligations.\n\n5. **Detailed Scope of Work**: \n   - While the contract mentions a scope of work, it would be beneficial to include a more detailed description of the tasks and deliverables to prevent scope creep.\n\n6. **Revisions and Changes**: \n   - The contract specifies two rounds of revisions, but it might be helpful to define what constitutes a \"revision\" to avoid misunderstandings.\n\n7. **Confidentiality Clause**: \n   - The confidentiality clause is present, but it could be expanded to specify the duration of confidentiality obligations and any exceptions.\n\n8. **Expenses**: \n   - The contract mentions additional expenses but could benefit from specifying examples of such expenses and the process for approval.\n\nOverall, the contract is quite comprehensive, but addressing these points would enhance its clarity and completeness. Therefore, the contract does not fully pass due to the need for additional clauses and clarification in certain areas."

For example, \"Buyer: Jane Doe, 123 Main St, Anytown, USA.

Therefore, it\u2019s advisable to limit the number of revisions on your agreement. [...] Project-based pricing, also known as flat-rate pricing, is when you charge a fixed price for the entire project, regardless of its duration. [...] Value-based pricing is when you charge based on the possible return on investment (ROI) that the client might gain from the web development project. This is usually a percentage of sales.",

    "drafting_consistency": "The contract appears to be well-structured and covers many essential elements. However, there are a few areas that could be improved or clarified:\n\n1. **Placeholder Usage**: \n   - Ensure that all placeholders such as [DATE], [CLIENT_ADDRESS], [CLIENT_CONTACT_INFORMATION], [CONTRACTOR_ADDRESS], [CONTRACTOR_CONTACT_INFORMATION], [COMPLETION_DATE], and [HOURLY_RATE] are filled in with the appropriate information before the contract is finalized.\n\n2. **Indemnification Clause**: \n   - As suggested, adding an indemnification clause would be beneficial to protect both parties from any claims or liabilities arising from the project.\n\n3. **Non-Solicitation Clause**: \n   - Including a non-solicitation clause could help protect both parties' business interests by preventing the poaching of employees or contractors.\n\n4. **Force Majeure Clause**: \n   - Adding a force majeure clause would provide protection against unforeseen events that could prevent either party from fulfilling their contractual obligations.\n\n5. **Detailed Scope of Work**: \n   - While the contract mentions a scope of work, it would be beneficial to include a more detailed description of the tasks and deliverables to prevent scope creep.\n\n6. **Revisions and Changes**: \n   - The contract specifies two rounds of revisions, but it might be helpful to define what constitutes a \"revision\" to avoid misunderstandings.\n\n7. **Confidentiality Clause**: \n   - The confidentiality clause is present, but it could be expanded to specify the duration of confidentiality obligations and any exceptions.\n\n8. **Expenses**: \n   - The contract mentions additional expenses but could benefit from specifying examples of such expenses and the process for approval.\n\nOverall, the contract is quite comprehensive, but addressing these points would enhance its clarity and completeness. Therefore, the contract does not fully pass due to the need for additional clauses and clarification in certain areas.",

    "enforceability": "warning",
    "enforceability_details": "The improved contract addresses several of the weaknesses and missing elements identified in the draft contract. However, there are still some enforceability risks and areas for improvement:\n\n### Enforceability Risks\n\n1. **Scope of Work (Section 1)**:\n   - While the contract mentions that the scope of work will be agreed upon in writing, it is crucial to have a detailed description of the tasks and deliverables included in the contract itself or as an attached exhibit. This will help prevent disputes over what is included in the project.\n\n2. **Revisions and Changes (Section 4)**:\n   - The contract specifies two rounds of revisions, but it should also clarify what constitutes a \"revision\" to avoid misunderstandings. Additionally, the hourly rate for additional revisions should be specified.\n\n3. **Termination Clause (Section 7)**:\n   - The termination clause allows either party to terminate with 15 days' notice, but it does not specify the conditions under which termination is permissible. Consider adding specific grounds for termination, such as breach of contract or failure to perform.\n\n4. **Confidentiality (Section 6)**:\n   - The confidentiality clause is quite broad. It may be beneficial to define what constitutes \"proprietary information\" and specify any exceptions to confidentiality obligations.\n\n5. **Dispute Resolution (Section 8)**:\n   - The arbitration clause should specify the rules governing the arbitration process (e.g., American Arbitration Association rules) and the number of arbitrators.\n\n6. **Expenses (Section 11)**:\n   - The contract should specify what types of expenses might be incurred and require prior approval, to avoid disputes over what constitutes a reimbursable expense.\n\n7. **Contractor's Right to Use Client IP (Section 12)**:\n   - This section should clarify the scope and limitations of the Contractor's right to use the Client's intellectual property, ensuring it is only for the purpose of completing the project.\n\n### Additional Considerations\n\n- **Force Majeure**: Consider adding a force majeure clause to address unforeseen events that could impact the ability to perform under the contract.\n- **Indemnification**: An indemnification clause could protect both parties from third-party claims related to the project.\n- **Limitation of Liability**: Including a limitation of liability clause can help manage the risk of potential damages.\n\nOverall, the improved contract is more comprehensive than the draft, but addressing these enforceability risks and additional considerations will further strengthen the agreement.",

The contract contains clear payment terms, including the total amount ($500), the payment schedule (two installments of $250 each, due on the first of the month), and the currency (implicitly USD, as indicated by the dollar sign).

    "ip_details": "**Pass**\n\nThe contract clearly defines intellectual property ownership in Section 5. It specifies that upon full payment, the Client will own the final completed design deliverables and production-ready code created specifically for the project. This clause ensures that the Client gains ownership of the intellectual property rights once the payment is completed, which is a crucial aspect of intellectual property agreements. Additionally, the Contractor retains the right to use the completed project in a portfolio unless the Client requests confidentiality in writing, which is a common practice in creative service agreements.

However, there are areas where clarity could be improved to prevent potential misunderstandings:\n\n1. **Scope of Work**: The draft contract mentions a lack of detailed description, which could lead to scope creep. The improved contract addresses this by specifying that any work not explicitly described is out-of-scope and requires additional compensation. This resolves the initial concern.\n\n2. **Revisions and Changes**: The draft contract notes the absence of a limit on revisions. The improved contract addresses this by specifying two rounds of revisions and billing for additional revisions, which resolves the initial concern.\n\n3. **Termination Clause**: The draft contract highlights unclear termination conditions. The improved contract specifies a 15-day notice period for termination and payment for services up to the termination date, which resolves the initial concern.\n\n4. **Confidentiality**: The draft contract notes the absence of a confidentiality clause. The improved contract includes a confidentiality clause, which resolves the initial concern.\n\n5. **Dispute Resolution**: The draft contract mentions the lack of a dispute resolution method. The improved contract includes a clause for good-faith negotiation and binding arbitration, which resolves the initial concern.\n\n6. **Expenses**: The draft contract notes the absence of an outline for additional expenses. The improved contract includes a clause for additional expenses requiring client approval, which resolves the initial concern.\n\nOverall, the improved contract addresses the weaknesses and missing elements identified in the draft contract, and there are no apparent contradictions between the two versions."

Therefore, it\u2019s advisable to limit the number of revisions on your agreement. [...] Project-based pricing, also known as flat-rate pricing, is when you charge a fixed price for the entire project, regardless of its duration. [...] Value-based pricing is when you charge based on the possible return on investment (ROI) that the client might gain from the web development project. This is usually a percentage of sales."
